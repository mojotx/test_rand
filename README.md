# Random Number Distribution Test

For 1000 iterations, calculate a random number between 0-99, and if the
number is less than 30, it is a challenger, otherwise a champion.

Take the challenger numbers, and calculate if how close they are to 30%
of the population.

Check the population standard deviation as a measure of closeness.
